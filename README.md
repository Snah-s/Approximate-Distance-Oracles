# Approximate Distance Oracles

## Description

This repository contains the source code of the "Approximate Distance Oracle" project.The project implements a data structure to calculate approximate distances in undirected weighted graphs using landmarks. This structure allows for distance queries with efficient time complexity, similar to the A* algorithm in practice.
